	<h1>How It All Really Started</h1>
	<p><em>Published by</em><a href="cm-home.html">Cold Menace</a></p>
	
	<p>So behind the curtain of Cold Menace started out with just a few friends who one day thought that they needed an escape from the mundane during the winter. Nothing wild. No master plan. Just something to break the monotony, the kind of idea that happens in a half-serious group chat, right between a meme and a mental breakdown. Cory, Xander, and Hayden had known each other since high school. Not the kind of friends who talked every day, but the kind that came alive again when the group had some odd discourse about random things. When it starts to get cold and snow starts falling, Winter has a way of drawing them back.</p> 
		
	<div class="comic-panel"><img src="images/groupchat.jpg" alt="screenshot"><p>The explosion of purely funny memes</p></div>
	<p>That year, everything just felt. . . off, since Covid turned their lives upside down and inside out, and the world was just beginning to open up again. Cory had dropped out of school after a semester, and he mostly spent staring at the ceiling. Xander was still chasing freelance art gigs that never paid on time. Hayden was quieter than usual, fresh off the kind of breakup that doesn’t just take a person, it takes your sense of direction. So when someone floated the idea of starting something new, it wasn’t just about snowboarding, it was about needing somewhere to unwind, somewhere to feel alive again.</p> 
	
	<div class="comic-panel left"><img src="images/3menaces.jpg" alt="3 Menaces"><p>The friends embark on a most exciting endeavor . . .</p></div>
	<p>They weren’t pros by any means. Nor were they trying to be. In fact, this was the first time they even took part in this extreme sport. They rode with duct-taped gloves, thrifted jackets, and boards that had seen better years. But they had heart. And something about riding those freshly grazed trails felt more real than anything else that winter. There weren’t too many crowds. No music blaring over speakers. Just raw snow, the sharp bite of wind, and the occasional scrape of ice reminding you that nature didn’t care if you landed your jump or slammed into a tree.</p>
	<p>At first, it was just weekend rides or spontaneous trips.</p>
	<p>Then it became every couple of days.</p> 
	
	<div class="comic-panel"><img src="images/camcord1.jpg" alt="daytime run"><p>Don't really know how to work this thing. . . . nice shot tho - X</p></div>
	<p>Then the night runs. Then filming. The first clips were rough, phone footage, awkward commentary, way too many falls. But there was something oddly captivating about it. Cory said that the videos were “cold”, which was just another way to say that they were cool and unique. The friends called themselves “Menaces” as a joke, a phrase Hayden muttered after witnessing Xander eating it on a landing and face-planting into the frost: “I know bro’s hurting!” Then someone screamed, “He’s a menace, why would you let him do that?”  “At least he’s a cold menace!”</p> 
	
	<div class="comic-panel left"><img src="images/fail2.jpg" alt="Xanders fall"><p> I tried chat, it might be harder than it looks! SMH!</p></div>
	<p>The name stuck. And the footage, somehow, started spreading. At first, it was just people from around town. Other bored kids. Burnouts with boards. College drop-ins who couldn’t afford lift passes. Then strangers, people they didn’t know, started showing up on the trails. A guy from two towns over who’d seen a clip on Instagram. A girl from the city who said Cold Menace reminded her of something she didn’t know she missed. No one ever said it out loud, but something had started. Not a club. Not a brand. More like a movement, though even that sounded too formal. It was more like this: if the system wasn’t going to make space for you, you carved it out yourself, board first.</p> 
	<p>By mid-season, Cold Menace wasn’t just the three of them anymore. The crew grew, but there were no official invites. You showed up. You rode. You ate snow. You got back up. That was enough. Everyone was dealing with something: mental health, job stuff, family pressure, identity questions, and the mountain became this weird, sacred chaos where none of that had to be figured out.</p>
	<p>Riding became therapy. Well, not the kind you paid for directly, but the kind that hurt and healed at the same time. Every slam into powder was a kind of release. Every successful carve is a small miracle. Everyone who rode had their own reason, and that was just it. Some never said much. Some overshared on the first run while taking a lift. But everyone found a version of freedom out there.</p>
	
	<div class="comic-panel"><img src="images/logostill2.jpg" alt="mac-logo"><p>Wait so people actually like us?!? Whaaaa!?</p></div>
	<p>And yet, as Cold Menace grew, so did the whispers. People started calling it a “cult.” Not in the creepy, ritual way, but because people were obsessed. They tagged their gear. They branded their helmets. They called each other by trail names. “Menaces,” they were jokingly called. And when the crew built a bigger interest, some folks started asking: Is this a team? A gang? A problem?The authorities started noticing, too. Rangers tried closing off access to the trails. Signs went up. Fines were issued. That didn’t stop anyone. If anything, it made things worse, or better, depending on how you saw it. The Cold Menace project became something more than just a snowboarding thing. It was anti-permission. It was about earning your space, your ride, your wipeouts.</p> 
	
	<div class="comic-panel left"><img src="images/fail1.jpg" alt="face-pant"> <p>I cant feel my legs! * Groans in pain *</p></div>
	<p>The thing was, Cory, Xander, and Hayden never intended for any of it to happen. They didn’t set out to lead anything. They still wore some of the same beat-up gear. Still rode the same way, fast, imperfect, full of grit. They didn’t give speeches. They gave advice at the top of a drop. “Stay loose.” “Don’t fight the turn.” “If you’re scared, lean in harder.”</p>
	<p>The story of Cold Menace wasn’t one of overnight fame or some carefully executed plan. It was a bunch of people who felt overlooked, out of place, or burnt out and found something worth holding onto in this cold, strange world. It was made of shared crashes, cracked boards, inside jokes, and slightly frostbitten fingers. Of fire pits lit with shaky hands and conversations that only made sense when your adrenaline was still buzzing.</p> 
		
	<div class="comic-panel"><img src="images/snowcovered.jpg" alt="new friends"><p>This is the real reason we ride! :D</p></div>
	<p>Somewhere along the way, people started calling it a brotherhood. Others, a rebellion. For Cory, Xander, and Hayden, it was just what winter turned into when everything else stopped making sense.</p>
	<p>And maybe that’s all it needed to be.</p>
	<p>Because in a world obsessed with outcomes and perfection, the Cold Menace Project was about the experience. About surviving the wipeout. About building something beautiful from the wreckage of expectations.</p>
	<p>Not a brand, yet.</p>
	<p>Not a business, either.</p>
	<p>Just a project that inspired us to live again, and somehow, in all its chaos... did for others.</p>
