      <h2>Our Drive</h2>
		
		<p>At Cold Menace, we aim to create a seamless and fun experience for users to share and explore honest reviews. Whether it’s a product, service, or unforgettable experience—your voice matters. We believe that the stories and insights shared by real people help build a stronger, more informed community.</p>
		
		<p>Skiing and snowboarding are some of the most exhilarating winter activities out there, but they don’t come without challenges. From gear selection to trail conditions, and everything in between, riders often spend just as much time preparing as they do shredding the slopes. That’s where <a href="home.html">Cold Menace </a>comes in.</p>
		<p>We know that riders travel from far and wide to chase the perfect run—so why not give life to those unique adventures right here? Whether you’re reviewing a hidden gem of a trail, rating your rental experience, or just want to share how the snow felt under your board, we’re building a space where every perspective counts.</p>
		
		<p>Cold Menace is more than just a review site—it’s a digital lodge where the snow community can connect, reflect, and ride forward together.</p>

			<div class="timeline-card">
				<h3>Year 1 – 2022: The Idea</h3>
				<p>Born out of the isolation and stillness of the COVID era, the Cold Menace project sparked to life. A once-silent group chat reignited with chaotic energy and shared ambition. What began as unhinged jokes and funny memes evolved into the seed of something real—a name, a vibe, and a mission to ride through the coolest conditions, together.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="timeline-card">
				<h3>Year 2 – 2023: The Trips</h3>
				<p>The crew embarked on their first <em>relatively underplanned</em> ski trip and against all odds, it was a massive win. Fueled by spontaneity and snacks, they explored mountains across the Northeast, talked with riders from all walks of life, and found inspiration in every fall, lesson, and laugh.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="timeline-card">
				<h3>Year 3 – 2024: The Project</h3>
				<p>Years of trial, discovery, and creativity began to crystallize. From notebooks and GoPro clips to serious drafts, the Cold Menace website began to take shape. Ideas turned into wireframes. Gear reviews, trail maps, and personal stories formed the foundation of a resource for beginners—by beginners.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="timeline-card">
				<h3>Year 4 – 2025: The Launch</h3>
				<p>The Cold Menace platform officially launched. A site built from scratch, with soul, went live offering guides, trail picks, and real-talk gear advice. Their first apparel drop sold out in a week. The first community ride took place in Pennsylvania, marking Cold Menace’s arrival as a true movement.</p>
